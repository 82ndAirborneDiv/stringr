# Introduction

`stringr` provides clean, consistent interface to common string operations.  Its ideals:

 * deal with factors and characters identically
 * common function names, arguments names and orders
 * eliminate options that you don't need 95% of the time (for that other 5% of the time you can still use the base functions)
 * missing inputs result in missing outputs, zero length inputs result in zero length outputs
 * output data structures from each function are matched to the input data 
 structures of other functions.
 
 * complete R's string handling functions with useful functions found in other programming languages
