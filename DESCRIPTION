Package: stringr
Version: 0.9.0.9000
Title: Simple, Consistent Wrappers for Common String Operations.
Description: A consistent, simple and easy to use set of wrappers around the
    fantastic stringi package. All function and argument names (and positions)
    are consistent, all functions deal with NA's and zero length character
    appropriately, and the output data structures from each function matches
    the input data structures of other functions.
